# llmchat_web/services.py
"""
Service layer for llmchat-web.

This module will contain business logic that interacts with LLMCore
and is called by the route handlers. For example, functions to
orchestrate complex session operations, context management logic
not directly tied to a single API call, etc.

Currently, route handlers in routes.py call LLMCore methods directly.
As complexity grows, logic can be moved here.
